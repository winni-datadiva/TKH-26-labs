    "## A Note About This Lab (And Real-World Data Work)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While this lab is a **guided EDA experience**, it is important to understand that in real data analyst and data scientist roles, you will often **not** be given step-by-step prompts like the ones you see here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In professional settings, you are usually given:\n",
    "- A dataset\n",
    "- A business or research problem\n",
    "- A general goal (e.g., reduce readmissions, improve patient outcomes, reduce cost)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, **you are responsible for:**\n",
    "- Investigating the data structure\n",
    "- Identifying data quality issues\n",
    "- Deciding which questions are worth asking\n",
    "- Determining which visualizations or summaries help answer those questions\n",
    "- Translating findings into real-world recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is designed to help you **practice the thinking process** you will need later:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 What questions should I ask first? \n",
    "👉 What patterns should I check for? \n",
    "👉 What might leadership or stakeholders care about? \n",
    "👉 What might be misleading if I only look at high-level summaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress through the course, prompts will become less specific, and you will be expected to:\n",
    "- Formulate your own analytical questions \n",
    "- Choose appropriate methods independently \n",
    "- Justify your analytical decisions \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That transition is intentional and it reflects how real data work happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not just learning tools. \n",
    "You are learning how to **think like an analyst.**\n",
