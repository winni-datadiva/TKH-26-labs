        "You will work through four activities:\n",
        "1. Warm-up: writing simple functions\n",
        "2. Concept practice: parameters and return values\n",
        "3. Application: conditionals inside functions\n",
        "4. Challenge: combining functions + conditionals for a mini \"eligibility\" workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives\n",
        "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
        "- Define and call Python functions\n",
        "- Use parameters and return values effectively\n",
        "- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions\n",
        "- Combine functions and conditionals to solve a small problem\n",
